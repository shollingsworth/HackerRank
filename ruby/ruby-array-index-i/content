Array collections offer various ways to access their elements.

The positions are ` 0 ` indexed. Objects of the array can be accessed using
the ` [] ` method which may take various arguments, as explained below.

    
    
    arr = [9, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, -1]
    

  * A number which is the position of element 

    
    
    >>arr[4]
      => 3

or

    
    
    >>arr.at(4)
      => 3 

  * A range indicating the start and the end position 

    
    
    >>arr[1..3] # .. indicates both indices are inclusive. 
      => [5,1,2]
    >>arr[1...3] # ... indicates the last index is excluded.
      => [5,1]

  * Start index and the length of the range 

    
    
    >>arr[1,4]
      => [5, 1, 2, 3]

For this challenge, your task is to complete the functions using syntax as
explained above.
