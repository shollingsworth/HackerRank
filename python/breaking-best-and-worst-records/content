Maria plays  games of college basketball in a season. Because she wants to go
pro, she tracks her points scored per game sequentially in an array defined as
. After each game  , she checks to see if score  breaks her record for most or
least points scored so far during that season.

Given Maria's array of  for a season of  games, find and print the number of
times she breaks her record for _ most _ and _ least _ points scored during
the season.

** Note: ** Assume her records for most and least points at the start of the season are the number of points scored during the first game of the season. 

** Input Format **

The first line contains an integer denoting  (the number of games).  
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective
values of  .

** Constraints **

  *   * 

** Output Format **

Print two space-seperated integers describing the respective numbers of times
her best (highest) score increased and her worst (lowest) score decreased.

** Sample Input 0 **
    
    
    9
    10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1

The diagram below depicts the number of times Maria broke her best and worst
records throughout the season:

She broke her best record twice (after games  and  ) and her worst record four
times (after games  ,  ,  , and  ), so we print ` 2 4 ` as our answer. Note
that she _ did not _ break her record for best score during game  , as her
score during that game was _ not _ strictly greater than her best record at
the time.

** Sample Input 1 **
    
    
    10
    3 4 21 36 10 28 35 5 24 42
    

** Sample Output 1 **
    
    
    4 0

She broke her best record four times (after games  ,  ,  , and  ) and her
worst record zero times (no score during the season was lower than the one she
earned during her first game), so we print ` 4 0 ` as our answer.
