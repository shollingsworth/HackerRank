We define a [ magic square ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square) to be
an  matrix of distinct positive integers from  to  where the sum of any row,
column, or diagonal (of length  ) is always equal to the same number (i.e.,
the _ magic constant _ ).

Consider a  matrix,  , of integers in the inclusive range  . We can convert
any digit,  , to any other digit,  , in the range  at cost  .

Given  , convert it into a magic square at _ minimal _ cost by changing zero
or more of its digits. Then print this cost on a new line.

** Note: ** The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range  . 

** Input Format **

There are  lines of input. Each line describes a row of the matrix in the form
of  space-separated integers denoting the respective first, second, and third
elements of that row.

** Constraints **

  * All integers in  are in the inclusive range  . 

** Output Format **

Print an integer denoting the minimum cost of turning matrix  into a magic
square.

** Sample Input 0 **
    
    
    4 9 2
    3 5 7
    8 1 5
    

** Sample Output 0 **

Matrix  initially looks like this:

    
    
    4 9 2
    3 5 7
    8 1 5
    

Observe that it's not yet magic, because not all rows, columns, and center
diagonals sum to the same number.

If we change the bottom right value,  , from  to  at a cost of  ,  becomes a
magic square at the minimum possible cost. Thus, we print the cost,  , on a
new line.

** Sample Input 1 **
    
    
    4 8 2
    4 5 7
    6 1 6
    

** Sample Output 1 **
    
    
    4
    

** Explanation 1 **

Considering 0 - based indexing if we make  -&gt; at a cost of :  ,  -&gt; at a
cost of :  and  -&gt; at a cost of :  , then net cost will be (  ).
