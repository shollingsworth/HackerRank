Brie?s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their  -page book to page number
. Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page
number  ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number  ), and she always
turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at
once). When she opens the book, page  is always on the right side:

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page
which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the
book (see the _ Explanation _ sections below for additional diagrams).

Given  and  , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in
order to arrive at page  .

Because we want to print the minumum number of page turns, we print  as our
answer.
