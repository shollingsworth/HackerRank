Consider an array of numeric strings,  , where each string is a positive
number with anywhere from  to  digits. Sort the array's elements in _ non-
decreasing _ (i.e., ascending) order of their real-world integer values and
print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

** Input Format **

The first line contains an integer,  , denoting the number of strings in  .  
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a string of integers describing an
element of the array.

** Constraints **

  *   * Each string is guaranteed to represent a positive integer without leading zeros. 
  * The total number of digits across all strings in  is between  and  (inclusive). 

** Output Format **

Print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

** Explanation 0 **

The initial array of strings is  . When we order each string by the real-world
integer value it represents, we get:

We then print each value on a new line, from smallest to largest.
