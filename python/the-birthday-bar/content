Lily has a chocolate bar consisting of a row of  squares where each square has
an integer written on it. She wants to share it with Ron for his birthday,
which falls on month  and day  . Lily wants to give Ron a piece of chocolate
only if it contains  consecutive squares whose integers sum to  .

Given  ,  , and the sequence of integers written on each square of Lily's
chocolate bar, how many different ways can Lily break off a piece of chocolate
to give to Ron?

For example, if  ,  and the chocolate bar contains  rows of squares with the
integers  written on them from left to right, the following diagram shows two
ways to break off a piece:

** Input Format **

The first line contains an integer denoting  (the number of squares in the
chocolate bar).  
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective
values of  (the numbers written on each consecutive square of chocolate).  
The third line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective
values of  (Ron's birth _ day _ ) and  (Ron's birth _ month _ ).

** Constraints **

  *   * , where (  ) 
  *   * 

** Output Format **

Print an integer denoting the total number of ways that Lily can give a piece
of chocolate to Ron.

** Explanation 1 **

Lily only wants to give Ron  consecutive squares of chocolate whose integers
sum to  . There are no possible pieces satisfying these constraints:

Thus, we print  as our answer.

** Sample Output 2 **
    
    
    1
    

** Explanation 2 **

Lily only wants to give Ron  square of chocolate with an integer value of  .
Because the only square of chocolate in the bar satisfies this constraint, we
print  as our answer.
