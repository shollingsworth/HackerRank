The _ itertools _ module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient
tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an
_ iterator algebra _ making it possible to construct specialized tools
succinctly and efficiently in pure _ Python _ .

To read more about the functions in this module, check out their [
documentation here ](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html) .

You are given a list of  lowercase English letters. For a given integer  , you
can select any  indices (assume  -based indexing) with a uniform probability
from the list.

Find the _ probability _ that _ at least _ one of the  indices selected will
contain the letter: '  '.

** Input Format **

The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the integer  ,
denoting the length of the list. The next line consists of  space-separated
lowercase English letters, denoting the elements of the list.

The third and the last line of input contains the integer  , denoting the
number of indices to be selected.

** Output Format **

Output a single line consisting of the _ probability _ that _ at least _ one
of the  indices selected contains the letter:'  '.

** Note ** : The answer must be correct up to 3 decimal places. 

** Constraints **

_ All the letters in the list are lowercase English letters. _

** Sample Input **
    
    
    4 
    a a c d
    2
    

** Sample Output **
    
    
    0.8333
    

** Explanation **

All possible unordered tuples of length  comprising of indices from  to  are:

Out of these  combinations,  of them contain either index  or index  which are
the indices that contain the letter '  '.

Hence, the answer is  .
