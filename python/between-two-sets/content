Consider two sets of positive integers,  and  . We say that a positive
integer,  , is _ between _ sets  and  if the following conditions are
satisfied:

  1. All elements in  are factors of  . 
  2. is a factor of all elements in  . 

In other words, some  is _ between _ and  if that value of  satisfies  for
every  in  and also satisfies  for every  in  . For example, if  and  , then
our possible  values are  and  .

Given  and  , find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible  's) that
are _ between _ the two sets.

** Input Format **

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective
values of  (the number of elements in set  ) and  (the number of elements in
set  ).  
The second line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing  .  
The third line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing  .

** Constraints **

  *   *   * 

** Output Format **

Print the number of integers that are considered to be _ between _ and  .

** Sample Input **
    
    
    2 3
    2 4
    16 32 96
    

** Sample Output **
    
    
    3
    

** Explanation **

There are three  values _ between _ and  :

  * : 
    * All the elements in  evenly divide  . 
    * evenly divides all the elements in  . 
  * : 
    * All the elements in  evenly divide  . 
    * evenly divides all the elements in  . 
  * : 
    * All the elements in  evenly divide  . 
    * evenly divides all the elements in  . 

Thus, we print  as our answer.
