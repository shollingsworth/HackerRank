You are given four points  and  in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
system. You are required to print the angle between the plane made by the
points  and  in degrees( ** not radians ** ). Let the angle be  .  

where  x  and  x  .

Here,  means the dot product of  and  , and  x  means the cross product of
vectors  and  . Also,  .

** Input Format **

One line of input containing the space separated floating number values of the
and  coordinates of a point.

** Output Format **

Output the angle correct up to two decimal places.
