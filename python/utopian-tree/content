The Utopian Tree goes through _ 2 _ cycles of growth every year. Each spring,
it _ doubles _ in height. Each summer, its height increases by _ 1 _ meter.

Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of _ 1 _ meter at the onset
of spring. How tall will her tree be after  growth cycles?

** Input Format **

The first line contains an integer,  , the number of test cases.  
subsequent lines each contain an integer,  , denoting the number of cycles for
that test case.

** Constraints **   
  

** Output Format **

For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after  cycles. Each
height must be printed on a new line.

** Sample Input **
    
    
    3
    0
    1
    4
    

** Sample Output **
    
    
    1
    2
    7
    

** Explanation **

There are _ 3 _ test cases.

In the first case (  ), the initial height (  ) of the tree remains unchanged.

In the second case (  ), the tree doubles in height and is  meters tall after
the spring cycle.

In the third case (  ), the tree doubles its height in spring (  ), then grows
a meter in summer (  ), then doubles after the next spring (  ), and grows
another meter after summer (  ). Thus, at the end of 4 cycles, its height is
meters.
