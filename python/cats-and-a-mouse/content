Two cats named  and  are standing at integral points on the x-axis. Cat  is
standing at point  and cat  is standing at point  . Both cats run at the same
speed, and they want to catch a mouse named  that's hiding at integral point
on the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?

You are given  queries in the form of  ,  , and  . For each query, print the
appropriate answer on a new line:

  * If cat  catches the mouse first, print ` Cat A ` . 
  * If cat  catches the mouse first, print ` Cat B ` . 
  * If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print ` Mouse C ` as the two cats fight and mouse escapes. 

** Input Format **

The first line contains a single integer,  , denoting the number of queries.  
Each of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers
describing the respective values of  (cat  's location),  (cat  's location),
and  (mouse  's location).

** Constraints **

  *   * 

** Output Format **

On a new line for each query, print ` Cat A ` if cat  catches the mouse first,
` Cat B ` if cat  catches the mouse first, or ` Mouse C ` if the mouse
escapes.

_ Query 0: _ The positions of the cats and mouse are shown below:

Cat  will catch the mouse first, so we print ` Cat B ` on a new line.

_ Query 1 _ : In this query, cats  and  reach mouse  at the exact same time:

Because the mouse escapes, we print ` Mouse C ` on a new line.
