HackerLand Enterprise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy. When they
launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly  people on social media.

On the first day, half of those  people (i.e.,  ) like the advertisement and
each person shares it with  of their friends; the remaining people (i.e.,  )
delete the advertisement because it doesn't interest them. So, at the
beginning of the second day,  people receive the advertisement.

On the second day, half of the  people who received the advertisement share it
with  new friends. So, at the beginning of the third day,  people receive the
advertisement. The diagram below depicts the advertisement's virality over the
first three days (green denotes a person that likes the advertisement and red
denotes a person that disliked and deleted it):
