You are given an integer  followed by  email addresses. Your task is to print
a list containing only _ valid _ email addresses in lexicographical order.  
  

Valid email addresses must follow these rules:

  * It must have the _ username@websitename.extension _ format type. 
  * The username can only contain letters, digits, dashes and underscores. 
  * The website name can only have letters and digits. 
  * The maximum length of the extension is  .   
  

** Concept **

A _ filter _ takes a function returning _ True _ or _ False _ and applies it
to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence where
the function returned _ True _ . A _ Lambda _ function can be used with
filters.  
  
Let's say you have to make a list of the squares of integers from  to  (both
included).  

    
    
    >> l = list(range(10))
    >> l = list(map(lambda x:x*x, l))
    

Now, you only require those elements that are greater than  but less than  .  

    
    
    >> l = list(filter(lambda x: x > 10 and x < 80, l))
    

Easy, isn't it?

** Input Format **

The first line of input is the integer  , the number of email addresses.  
lines follow, each containing a string.

** Constraints **

Each line is a non-empty string.

** Output Format **

Output a list containing the valid email addresses in lexicographical order.
If the list is empty, just output an empty list, [].
