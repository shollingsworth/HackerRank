So far, we have only heard of Python's powers. Now, we will witness them!

Powers or exponents in Python can be calculated using the built-in power
function. Call the power function  as shown below:

    
    
    >>> pow(a,b) 
    

or

    
    
    >>> a**b
    

It's also possible to calculate  .

    
    
    >>> pow(a,b,m)  
    

This is very helpful in computations where you have to print the resultant %
mod.

** Note ** : Here,  and  can be floats or negatives, but, if a third argument is present,  cannot be negative. 

** Note ** : Python has a math module that has its own _ pow() _ . It takes two arguments and returns a float. Frankly speaking, we will never use _ math.pow() _ . 

** Task **   
You are given three integers:  ,  , and  , respectively. Print two lines.  
The first line should print the result of _ pow(a,b) _ . The second line
should print the result of _ pow(a,b,m) _ .

** Input Format **   
The first line contains  , the second line contains  , and the third line
contains  .
