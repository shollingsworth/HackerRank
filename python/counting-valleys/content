Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close
attention to small details like topography. During his last hike, he took
exactly  steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an _ uphill _ or a
_ downhill _ step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level. We define the
following terms:

  * A _ mountain _ is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps _ above _ sea level, starting with a step _ up _ from sea level and ending with a step _ down _ to sea level. 
  * A _ valley _ is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps _ below _ sea level, starting with a step _ down _ from sea level and ending with a step _ up _ to sea level. 

Given Gary's sequence of _ up _ and _ down _ steps during his last hike, find
and print the number of _ valleys _ he walked through.

** Input Format **

The first line contains an integer,  , denoting the number of steps in Gary's
hike.  
The second line contains a single string of  characters. Each character is
(where ` U ` indicates a step _ up _ and ` D ` indicates a step _ down _ ),
and the  character in the string describes Gary's  step during the hike.

** Constraints **

  * 

** Output Format **

Print a single integer denoting the number of valleys Gary walked through
during his hike.

** Sample Input **
    
    
    8
    UDDDUDUU
    

** Sample Output **
    
    
    1
    

** Explanation **

If we represent ` _ ` as sea level, a step up as ` / ` , and a step down as `
\ ` , Gary's hike can be drawn as:

    
    
    _/\      _
       \    /
        \/\/
    

It's clear that there is only one valley there, so we print  on a new line.
