Lily likes to play games with integers and their _ reversals _ . For some
integer  , we define  to be the reversal of all digits in  . For example,  ,
, and  .

Logan wants to go to the movies with Lily on some day  satisfying  , but he
knows she only goes to the movies on days she considers to be _ beautiful _ .
Lily considers a day to be _ beautiful _ if the absolute value of the
difference between  and  is evenly divisible by  .

Given  ,  , and  , count and print the number of _ beautiful _ days when Logan
and Lily can go to the movies.

** Input Format **

A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective
values of  ,  , and  .

** Constraints **

  *   * 

** Output Format **

Print the number of _ beautiful _ days in the inclusive range between  and  .

** Sample Input **
    
    
    20 23 6
    

** Sample Output **
    
    
    2
    

** Explanation **

Logan wants to go to the movies on days  ,  ,  , and  . We perform the
following calculations to determine which days are _ beautiful _ :

  * Day  is _ beautiful _ because the following evaluates to a whole number: 
  * Day  is _ not beautiful _ because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: 
  * Day  is _ beautiful _ because the following evaluates to a whole number: 
  * Day  is _ not beautiful _ because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: 

Only two days,  and  , in this interval are beautiful. Thus, we print  as our
answer.
