Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of its elements are _
positive _ , which fraction of its elements are _ negative _ , and which
fraction of its elements are _ zeroes _ , respectively. Print the decimal
value of each fraction on a new line.

** Note: ** This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable. 

** Input Format **

The first line contains an integer,  , denoting the size of the array.  
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing an array of
numbers  .

** Output Format **

You must print the following  lines:

  1. A decimal representing of the fraction of _ positive _ numbers in the array compared to its size. 
  2. A decimal representing of the fraction of _ negative _ numbers in the array compared to its size. 
  3. A decimal representing of the fraction of _ zeroes _ in the array compared to its size. 

** Sample Input **
    
    
    6
    -4 3 -9 0 4 1         
    

** Sample Output **
    
    
    0.500000
    0.333333
    0.166667
    

** Explanation **

There are  positive numbers,  negative numbers, and  zero in the array.  
The respective fractions of positive numbers, negative numbers and zeroes are
,  and  , respectively.
